In the documentation https://sns.guide/domain-name/domain-direct-lookup.html
the example for IPFS is wrong, it pass true instead of a RecordVersion object
the correct example is:
getDomainKeySync(record, RecordVersion.V1);

Typo in the documentation of reverseLookupBatch
miss an 's' in the word 'nameAccounts'

simplify the function reverseLookupBatch by using the function getReverseKeyFromDomainKey

redondance in NameRegistryState, can be factorized by reusing the function fn() in _retrieveBatch

Function resolveSolRecordV2 untested

function const [favKey] = FavouriteDomain.getKeySync(
    NAME_OFFERS_ID,
    new PublicKey(owner),
  ); in the file favorite-domain.ts pass PublicKey(owner) instead of owner (already a PublicKey)

Inconsistent naming of the file favorite-domain.ts and the class FavouriteDomain
favorite !== favourite

In favorite.test.ts, the test with reverse: "1.00728" failed in Favorite domain and Multiple favorite domain

Signature of closure from nft/retrieveRecords.ts is weird, should pass Publikey instead of Account

Typo: InvalidParrentError should be InvalidParentError

Function updateRecordInstruction is not tested

Inconsistent naming deleteRecordV2 should be deleteRecordInstructionV2 or deleteRecordV2Instruction

The test resolve.sns-ip-5-wallet-12 does not raise the correct error WrongValidation instead of InvalidRoa
but the test function look to not test any error

Deprecated function used in createNameRegistry
